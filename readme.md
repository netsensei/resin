## Resin App

Resin for your [Resolver](https://github.com/PACKED-vzw/resolver). This application will take your bare data and generate
a nice, valid import CSV file for the resolver application. Additionally, the
app will report if your list of URL's and objects match, how many items will
be or won't be merged, and what you could do about it.
